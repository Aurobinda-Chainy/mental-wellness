                                <li>Dissociation itself is a normal experience to some degree. Daydreaming or zoning out
                                    for a moment are examples of mild dissociation. However, in dissociative disorders,
                                    this disconnection becomes severe and interferes with daily life.</li>
                                <li>There are several types of dissociative disorders, each with its own characteristic
                                
                                <li>Dissociative disorders are often linked to experiencing trauma, particularly in
                                    childhood. This trauma can be physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, neglect, or
                                    witnessing a traumatic event.</li>
                                <li>There is no single cure for dissociative disorders, but treatment can effectively
                                    manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Therapy, particularly psychotherapy, is
                                    a mainstay of treatment. Medication may also be helpful in some cases.</li>

                                <li>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental health condition that disrupts how the

                                            <li>Psychosis: This is a loss of touch with reality. People with schizophrenia
                                                may experience delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or
